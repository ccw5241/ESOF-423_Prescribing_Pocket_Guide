		<h2>The Prescribing Pocket Guide</h2>
		<p>
			The purpose of this project is to create a web application for the diagnosis of depression. 
			The application will be completely online to where users can access it from 
			anywhere with devices such as a PC or tablet. The diagnosis is based upon the 
			"Prescribing Pocket Guide 2012" for diagnosis and treatment of depression through 
			using questionnaires and scoring metrics. Modifying and creating these questionnaires
			and scoring metrics will also be a feature to allow for future expansion.
		</p><p>
			Being a 100% online service, no installation or downloads are necessary to run the product. 
			This is to allow the most freedom to the user in terms of accessibility. 
			Currently, user creation and basic user functionalities are supported through 
			the 'sign up' and 'sign in' pages respectively. However, these are very much not the final 
			iterations and are not intended for use as a secure account at this moment.
		</p><p>
			Below a link can be found that will allow for bug tracking and will automatically 
			notify and save your response for review. In doing so, please provide detailed 
			information describing what the bug is, what browser you are using, exact steps to 
			reproduce the bug, as well as the actual and expected results.
